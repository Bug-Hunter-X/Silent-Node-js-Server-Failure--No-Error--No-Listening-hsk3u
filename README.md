# Silent Node.js Server Failure

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle issue in Node.js where a server fails to start listening on a port without providing any error messages in the console.  This can be incredibly frustrating to debug.

## The Problem

The `server.js` file contains a simple HTTP server.  Under certain circumstances (e.g., port already in use, permission issues, firewall restrictions), this server might fail to start without any obvious indication.  The console will remain silent, leading to confusion.

## Potential Causes

* **Port in Use:** Another process might already be using the specified port.
* **Permissions:** The user running the Node.js process may lack sufficient permissions to bind to the port.
* **Firewall:** A firewall could be blocking the port.
* **Silent Crash:** An unhandled exception within the request handler could cause the server to crash silently.
* **OS/Network Issues:**  Underlying OS or network problems may prevent the server from listening.

## Solution

The `serverSolution.js` file provides a more robust solution.  It includes error handling to catch and report potential issues when the server attempts to listen on the port, providing more informative error messages.
